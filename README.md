## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleanup

Before conducting the analysis, the data was cleaned to ensure it was free of errors and ready for meaningful insights.  
The following checks were applied:

- âœ… Excluded all rows where **`Quantity < 1`** (returns or incorrect entries)
- âœ… Excluded rows where **`UnitPrice < 0`** (pricing errors)
- âœ… Added a **calculated column** for `Revenue = Quantity * UnitPrice`

These transformations ensured all analysis was based on valid, transaction-level data.
